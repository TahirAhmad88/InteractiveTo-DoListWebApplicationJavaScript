# InteractiveTo-DoListWebApplicationJavaScript
Built a dynamic web-based To-Do List application leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features include adding, deleting, marking as complete, and persisting tasks. This project reinforced my skills in DOM manipulation, event listeners, and local storage management for front-end development.
